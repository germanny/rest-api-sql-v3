Treehouse Project 9 - REST API using Express

This project is a REST API using Express. This API provides a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. Users interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses.

To make changes to the database, users must be authenticated. So the API will also allow users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account.
